I am Jiahui Zhai, a senior physics student at Xiamen University with a focus on computational physics, quantum-inspired optimization, and nonlinear dynamics. My research integrates physical principles into computational models to address complex systems.

### Research Focus
- **Quantum-Inspired Optimization**: Developed efficient multi-level erasure protocols, applying model-free reinforcement learning to quantum systems.
- **Multiscale Nucleation Modeling**: Extended Persistent-embryo approach for ultra-high pressure conditions, focusing on nucleation rates and critical nucleus size.
- **Nonlinear Dynamics**: Analyzed chaotic dynamics in three-body interactions and neural networks through the FPUT model.

### Academic Highlights
- **Q-SITE Hackathon**: Awarded qBraid-AWS prize for quantum computing applications.
- **Mathematical Contest in Modelling (MCM)**: Analyzed ecological stability models in aquatic ecosystems.

### Technical Proficiencies
- **Programming**: Python, MATLAB, C
- **Computational Tools**: LAMMPS, Ovito, VMD
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch

My goal is to advance quantum machine learning and algorithmic efficiency by applying physics-based constraints for robustness in computational models. 

Thank you for visiting.
